== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct deploys a Kinesis Stream and configures a
AWS Glue Job to perform custom ETL transformation with the appropriate
resources/properties for interaction and security. It also creates an S3
bucket where the python script for the AWS Glue Job can be uploaded.

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

====
[role="tablist"]
Typescript::
+
[source,typescript]
----
import * as glue from "@aws-cdk/aws-glue";
import * as s3assets from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3-assets";
import { KinesisstreamsToGluejob } from "@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-kinesisstreams-gluejob";

const fieldSchema: glue.CfnTable.ColumnProperty[] = [
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "int",
    comment: "Identifier for the record",
  },
  {
    name: "name",
    type: "string",
    comment: "Name for the record",
  },
  {
    name: "address",
    type: "string",
    comment: "Address for the record",
  },
  {
    name: "value",
    type: "int",
    comment: "Value for the record",
  },
];

const customEtlJob = new KinesisstreamsToGluejob(this, "CustomETL", {
  glueJobProps: {
    command: {
      name: "gluestreaming",
      pythonVersion: "3",
    },
  },
  fieldSchema: fieldSchema,
  etlCodeAsset: new s3assets.Asset(this, "ScriptLocation", {
    path: `${__dirname}/../etl/transform.py`,
  }),
});

|outputBucket?

|Returns an array of recommended CloudWatch Alarms created by the
construct for Kinesis Data stream.
|===

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

=== Amazon Kinesis Stream

* Configure least privilege access IAM role for Kinesis Stream
* Enable server-side encryption for Kinesis Stream using AWS Managed KMS
Key
* Deploy best practices CloudWatch Alarms for the Kinesis Stream

=== Glue Job

* Create a Glue Security Config that configures encryption for
CloudWatch, Job Bookmarks, and S3. CloudWatch and Job Bookmarks are
encrypted using AWS Managed KMS Key created for AWS Glue Service. The S3
bucket is configured with SSE-S3 encryption mode
* Configure service role policies that allow AWS Glue to read from
Kinesis Data Streams

=== Glue Database

* Create an AWS Glue database. An AWS Glue Table will be added to the
database. This table defines the schema for the records buffered in the
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

=== Glue Table

* Create an AWS Glue table. The table schema definition is based on the
JSON structure of the records buffered in the Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams

=== IAM Role

* A job execution role that has privileges to 1) read the ETL script
from the S3 bucket location, 2) read records from the Kinesis Stream,
and 3) execute the Glue Job

=== Output S3 Bucket

* An S3 bucket to store the output of the ETL transformation. This
bucket will be passed as an argument to the created glue job so that it
can be used in the ETL script to write data into it

=== Cloudwatch Alarms

* A CloudWatch Alarm to report when consumer application is reading data
slower than expected
* A CloudWatch Alarm to report when consumer record processing is
falling behind (to avoid risk of data loss due to record expiration)
