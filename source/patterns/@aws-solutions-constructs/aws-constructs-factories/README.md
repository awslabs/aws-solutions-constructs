## Overview
This AWS Solutions Construct exposes the same code used to create our underlying resources as factories, so clients can create individual resources that are well-architected.

### S3 Buckets

Create fully well-architected S3 buckets with as little as one function call. Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

Typescript
``` typescript
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { ConstructsFactories } from '@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-constructs-factories';

const factories = new ConstructsFactories(this, 'integ-test');

factories.s3BucketFactory('test', {});
```

Python
``` python
# TBD
```

Java
``` java
// TBD
```

## S3BucketFactory Function Signature

``` typescript
s3BucketFactory(id: string, props: S3BucketFactoryProps): S3BucketFactoryResponse
```

## S3BucketFactoryProps

| **Name**     | **Type**        | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|-----------------|
|bucketProps?|[`s3.BucketProps`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html)|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3 Bucket.|
|logS3AccessLogs?|`boolean`|Whether to turn on Access Logging for the S3 bucket. Creates an S3 bucket with associated storage costs for the logs. Enabling Access Logging is a best practice. default - true|
|loggingBucketProps?|[`s3.BucketProps`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html)|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3 Logging Bucket.|

## S3BucketFactoryResponse

| **Name**     | **Type**        | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|-----------------|
|s3Bucket|[`s3.Bucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html)|The s3.Bucket created by the factory. |
|s3LoggingBucket?|[`s3.Bucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html)|The s3.Bucket created by the construct as the logging bucket for the primary bucket. If the logS3AccessLogs property is false, this value will be undefined.|

## Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will set the following defaults:

* An S3 Content Bucket
  * AWS managed Server Side Encryption (AES256)
  * Lifecycle rule to transition objects to Glacier storage class in 90 days
  * Access Logging enabled
  * All Public access blocked
  * Versioning enabled
  * UpdateReplacePolicy is delete
  * Deletion policy is delete
  * Bucket policy requiring SecureTransport
* An S3 Bucket for Access Logs
  * AWS managed Server Side Encryption (AES256)
  * All public access blocked
  * Versioning enabled
  * UpdateReplacePolicy is delete
  * Deletion policy is delete
  * Bucket policy requiring SecureTransport
  * Bucket policy granting PutObject privileges to the S3 logging service, from the content bucket in the content bucket account.
  * cfn_nag suppression of access logging finding (not logging access to the access log bucket)
