== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct implements an Amazon Route 53 connected to
a configured Amazon API Gateway REST API.

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

import * as acm from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";
import { Route53ToApiGateway } from '@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-route53-apigateway';

// The construct requires an existing REST API, this can be created in raw CDK or extracted
// from a previously instantiated construct that created an API Gateway REST API
const existingRestApi = previouslyCreatedApigatewayToLambdaConstruct.apiGateway;

// domainName must match existing hosted zone in your account and the existing certificate
const ourHostedZone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'HostedZone', {
    domainName: "example.com",
});

const certificate = acm.Certificate.fromCertificateArn(
    this,
    "fake-cert",
    "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/11112222-3333-1234-1234-123456789012"

== Pattern Construct Props

This construct cannot create a new Public Hosted Zone, if you are
creating a public API you must supply an existing Public Hosted Zone
that will be reconfigured with a new Alias record. Public Hosted Zones
are configured with public domain names and are not well suited to be
launched and torn down dynamically, so this construct will only
reconfigure existing Public Hosted Zones.

This construct can create Private Hosted Zones. If you want a Private
Hosted Zone, then you can either provide an existing Private Hosted Zone
or a privateHostedZoneProps value with at least the Domain Name defined.
If you are using privateHostedZoneProps, an existing wildcard
certificate (*.example.com) must be issued from a previous domain to
be used in the newly created Private Hosted Zone. New certificate
creation and validation do not take place in this construct. A private
Rest API already exists in a VPC, so that VPC must be provided in the
existingVpc prop. There is no scenario where this construct can create a
new VPC (since it can’t create a new API), so the vpcProps property is
not supported on this construct.

|===
|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|publicApi |boolean |Whether the construct is deploying a private or
public API. This has implications for the Hosted Zone and VPC.

|privateHostedZoneProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_route53.PrivateHostedZoneProps.html[route53.PrivateHostedZoneProps]
|Optional custom properties for a new Private Hosted Zone. Cannot be
specified for a public API. Cannot specify a VPC, it will use the VPC in
existingVpc or the VPC created by the construct. Providing both this and
existingHostedZoneInterface is an error.

|existingHostedZoneInterface?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_route53.IHostedZone.html[route53.IHostedZone]
|Existing Public or Private Hosted Zone (type must match publicApi
setting). Specifying both this and privateHostedZoneProps is an error.
If this is a Private Hosted Zone, the associated VPC must be provided as
the existingVpc property.

|existingVpc?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.IVpc.html[ec2.IVpc]
|An existing VPC in which to deploy the construct.

|existingApiGatewayInterface
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.IRestApi.html[api.IRestApi]
|The existing API Gateway instance that will be connected to the Route
53 hosted zone. _Note that Route 53 can only be connected to a
configured API Gateway, so this construct only accepts an existing
IRestApi and does not accept apiGatewayProps._

|existingCertificateInterface
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_certificatemanager.ICertificate.html[certificatemanager.ICertificate]
|An existing AWS Certificate Manager certificate for your custom domain
name.

|hostedZone
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_route53.IHostedZone.html[route53.IHostedZone]
|The hosted zone used by the construct (whether created by the construct
or provided by the client)

|vpc?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.IVpc.html[ec2.IVpc]
|The VPC used by the construct.

|apiGateway
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.RestApi.html[api.RestApi]
|Returns an instance of the API Gateway REST API created by the pattern.

|certificate
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_certificatemanager.ICertificate.html[certificatemanager.ICertificate]
|THe certificate used by the construct (whether create by the construct
or provided by the client)
|===

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

=== Amazon Route53

* Adds an ALIAS record to the new or provided Hosted Zone that routes to
the construct’s API Gateway

=== Amazon API Gateway

* User provided API Gateway object is used as-is
* Sets up custom domain name mapping to API
