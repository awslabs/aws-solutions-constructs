// Stack
// -
// This stack provisions an "existing resource" that simulates use of the restaurant management system with a piece of
// the restaurant's existing infrastructure. In this case, this stack provisions an order archive bucket to which
// the contents of the table in the use case example will output closed orders to.
// -
// In your environment, use the static method fromBucketName() to include an actual existing
// bucket from your environment in this stack. More info:
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.Bucket.html#static-fromwbrbucketwbrnamescope-id-bucketname
