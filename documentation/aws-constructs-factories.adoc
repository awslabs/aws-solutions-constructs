== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct exposes the same code used to create our
underlying resources as factories, so clients can create individual
resources that are well-architected. There are factories to create:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-constructs-factories.html#s3-buckets[Amazon
S3 buckets] - Create a well architected S3 bucket (e.g. - includes an
access logging bucket)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-constructs-factories.html#step-functions-state-machines[AWS
Step Functions state machines] - Create a well architected Step
Functions state machine and log group (e.g. log group has
/aws/vendedlogs/ name prefix to avoid resource policy issues)

== S3 Buckets

Create fully well-architected S3 buckets with as little as one function
call. Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|bucketProps?

|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Bucket.

|logS3AccessLogs? |`boolean` |Whether to turn on Access Logging for the
S3 bucket. Creates an S3 bucket with associated storage costs for the
logs. Enabling Access Logging is a best practice. default - true

|loggingBucketProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html[`s3.BucketProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Logging Bucket.

== S3BucketFactoryResponse

[width="100%",cols="<30%,<35%,35%",options="header",]

|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|s3Bucket
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]
|The s3.Bucket created by the factory.

|s3LoggingBucket?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]
|The s3.Bucket created by the construct as the logging bucket for the
primary bucket. If the logS3AccessLogs property is false, this value
will be undefined.
|===

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

* An S3 Content Bucket
** AWS managed Server Side Encryption (AES256)
** Lifecycle rule to transition objects to Glacier storage class in 90
days
** Access Logging enabled
** All Public access blocked
** Versioning enabled
** UpdateReplacePolicy is delete
** Deletion policy is delete
** Bucket policy requiring SecureTransport
* An S3 Bucket for Access Logs
** AWS managed Server Side Encryption (AES256)
** All public access blocked
** Versioning enabled
** UpdateReplacePolicy is delete
** Deletion policy is delete
** Bucket policy requiring SecureTransport
** Bucket policy granting PutObject privileges to the S3 logging
service, from the content bucket in the content bucket account.
** cfn_nag suppression of access logging finding (not logging access
to the access log bucket)

== Step Functions State Machines

Create fully well-architected Step Functions state machine with log
group. The log group name includes the vendedlogs prefix. Here but is
unique to the stack, avoiding naming collions between instances. is a
minimal deployable pattern definition:

import { App, Stack } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { ConstructsFactories } from "../../lib";
import { generateIntegStackName, CreateTestStateMachineDefinitionBody } from '@aws-solutions-constructs/core';
import { IntegTest } from '@aws-cdk/integ-tests-alpha';

const placeholderTask = new sftasks.EvaluateExpression(this, 'placeholder', {
  expression: '$.argOne + $.argTwo'
});

const factories = new ConstructsFactories(this, 'minimalImplementation');

factories.stateMachineFactory('testsm', {
  stateMachineProps: {
    definitionBody: sfn.DefinitionBody.fromChainable(placeholderTask)
  }

|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|stateMachineProps
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_stepfunctions.StateMachineProps.html[`sfn.StateMachineProps`]
|The CDK properties that define the state machine. This property is
required and must include a definitionBody or definition (definition is
deprecated)

|logGroup?
|[]`logs.LogGroup`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_logs.LogGroup.html)
|An existing LogGroup to which the new state machine will write log
entries. Default: none, the construct will create a new log group.

|createCloudWatchAlarms? |boolean |Whether to create recommended
CloudWatch alarms for the State Machine. Default: the alarms are created

|cloudWatchAlarmsPrefix? |string |Creating multiple State Machines with
one Factories construct will result in name collisions as the cloudwatch
alarms originally had fixed resource ids. This value was added to avoid
collisions while not making changes that would be destructive for
existing stacks. Unless you are creating multiple State Machines using
factories you can ignore it

|The alarms created by the factory (ExecutionFailed, ExecutionThrottled,
ExecutionAborted)
|===

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

* An AWS Step Functions State Machine
** Configured to log to the new log group at LogLevel.ERROR
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs Log Group
** Log name is prefaced with /aws/vendedlogs/ to avoid resource policy
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/cw-logs.html#cloudwatch-iam-policy[issues].
The Log Group name is still created to be unique to the stack to avoid
name collisions.
* CloudWatch alarms for:
** 1 or more failed executions
** 1 or more executions being throttled
** 1 or more executions being aborted

CMK or an AWS managed key. This flag is ignored if any of the following
are defined: queueProps.encryptionMasterKey, encryptionKey or

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

* An SQS queue
** Encrypted by default with KMS managed key by default, can be KMS CMK
if flag is set
** Only queue owner can perform operations by default (your IAM policies
can override)
** Enforced encryption for data in transit
** DLQ configured
* An SQS dead letter queue
** Receives messages not processable in maxReceiveCount attempts
** Encrypted with KMS managed key
** Enforced encryption for data in transit
