== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct implements an Amazon S3 Bucket that is
configured to send S3 event messages to an Amazon SNS topic.

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

====
[role="tablist"]
Typescript::
+
[source,typescript]
----
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { S3ToSns } from "@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-s3-sns";

new S3ToSns(this, 'S3ToSNSPattern', {});
----

Python::
+
[source,python]
----
from aws_solutions_constructs.aws_s3_sns import S3ToSns
from aws_cdk import Stack
from constructs import Construct

S3ToSns(self, 'S3ToSNSPattern')
----

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
import software.constructs.Construct;

import software.amazon.awscdk.Stack;
import software.amazon.awscdk.StackProps;
import software.amazon.awsconstructs.services.s3sns.*;

new S3ToSns(this, "S3ToSNSPattern", new S3ToSnsProps.Builder()
        .build());

|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|existingBucketObj?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]
|Existing instance of S3 Bucket object. If this is provided, then also
providing bucketProps is an error.

|bucketProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html[`s3.BucketProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Bucket.

|s3EventTypes?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.EventType.html[`s3.EventType++[]++`]
|The S3 event types that will trigger the notification. Defaults to
s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED.

|s3EventFilters?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.NotificationKeyFilter.html[`s3.NotificationKeyFilter++[]++`]
|S3 object key filter rules to determine which objects trigger this
event. If not specified no filter rules will be applied.

|loggingBucketProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html[`s3.BucketProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Logging Bucket.

|logS3AccessLogs? |`boolean` |Whether to turn on Access Logging for the
S3 bucket. Creates an S3 bucket with associated storage costs for the
logs. Enabling Access Logging is a best practice. default - true

|existingTopicObj?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_sns.Topic.html[`sns.Topic`]
|An optional, existing SNS topic to be used instead of the default
topic. Providing both this and `topicProps` will cause an error. If the
SNS Topic is encrypted with a Customer-Managed KMS Key, the key must be
specified in the `existingTopicEncryptionKey` property.

|existingTopicEncryptionKey?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_kms.Key.html[`kms.Key`]
|If an existing topic is provided in the `existingTopicObj` property,
and that topic is encrypted with a Customer-Managed KMS key, this
property also needs to be set with same key.

|topicProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_sns.TopicProps.html[`sns.TopicProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the SNS
topic.

|enableEncryptionWithCustomerManagedKey? |`boolean` |If no key is
provided, this flag determines whether the topic is encrypted with a new
CMK or an AWS managed key. This flag is ignored if any of the following
are defined: topicProps.encryptionMasterKey, encryptionKey or
encryptionKeyProps.

|encryptionKey?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_kms.Key.html[`kms.Key`]
|An optional, imported encryption key to encrypt the SNS Topic with.

|encryptionKeyProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_kms.Key.html#construct-props[`kms.KeyProps`]
|Optional user provided properties to override the default properties
for the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the SNS Topic with.

|encryptionKey?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_kms.Key.html[`kms.Key`]
|Returns an instance of the kms.Key associated with the SNS Topic

|s3Bucket?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]

|s3LoggingBucket?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]
|Returns an instance of s3.Bucket created by the construct as the
logging bucket for the primary bucket.

|s3BucketInterface
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.IBucket.html[`s3.IBucket`]

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

==== Amazon S3 Bucket

* Configure Access logging for the S3 Bucket
* Enable server-side encryption for S3 Bucket using an AWS managed KMS
Key
* Enforce encryption of data in transit
* Turn on the versioning for the S3 Bucket
* Don’t allow public access for the S3 Bucket
* Retain the S3 Bucket when deleting the CloudFormation stack
* Applies Lifecycle rule to move noncurrent object versions to Glacier
storage after 90 days

==== Amazon SNS Topic

* Configure least privilege SNS Topic access policy to allow the S3
Bucket to publish messages to it
* Enable server-side encryption for the SNS Topic using an AWS managed
KMS Key
* Enforce encryption of data in transit
