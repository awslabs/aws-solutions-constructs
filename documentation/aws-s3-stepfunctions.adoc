== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct implements an Amazon S3 bucket connected to
an AWS Step Functions.

_Note - This constructs sends S3 Event Notification to EventBridge, then
triggers AWS Step Functions State Machine executions from EventBridge._

_An alternative architecture can be built that triggers a Lambda
function from S3 Event notifications using aws-s3-lambda and
aws-lambda-stepfunctions. Channelling the S3 events through Lambda is
less flexible than EventBridge, but is more cost effective and has lower
latency._

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

import * as stepfunctions from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-stepfunctions';

const startState = new stepfunctions.Pass(this, 'StartState');

new S3ToStepfunctions(this, 'test-s3-stepfunctions-stack', {
    stateMachineProps: {
      definition: startState
    }
});

|existingBucketObj?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.IBucket.html[`s3.IBucket`]
|Existing instance of S3 Bucket object. If this is provided, then also
providing bucketProps is an error. *The existing bucket must have
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-event-notifications-eventbridge.html[EventBridge
enabled] for this to work.*

|bucketProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html[`s3.BucketProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Bucket.

|stateMachineProps
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_stepfunctions.StateMachineProps.html[`sfn.StateMachineProps`]
|User provided props to override the default props for sfn.StateMachine.

|eventRuleProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_events.RuleProps.html[`events.RuleProps`]
|Optional user provided eventRuleProps to override the defaults.

|deployCloudTrail? |`boolean` |Whether to deploy a Trail in AWS
CloudTrail to log API events in Amazon S3. Defaults to `true`. *This is
now deprecated and ignored because the construct no longer needs
CloudTrail since it uses S3 Event Notifications*.

|createCloudWatchAlarms |`boolean` |Whether to create recommended
CloudWatch alarms.

|logGroupProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_logs.LogGroupProps.html[`logs.LogGroupProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for for the
CloudWatchLogs LogGroup.

|loggingBucketProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.BucketProps.html[`s3.BucketProps`]
|Optional user provided props to override the default props for the S3
Logging Bucket.

|logS3AccessLogs? |boolean |Whether to turn on Access Logging for the S3
bucket. Creates an S3 bucket with associated storage costs for the logs.
Enabling Access Logging is a best practice. default - true

|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html[`s3.Bucket`]
|Returns an instance of s3.Bucket created by the construct as the
logging bucket for the primary bucket.

|s3BucketInterface

|Returns an instance of s3.IBucket created by the construct.

_Note - with the release of Enable EventBridge for Amazon S3, AWS
CloudTrail is no longer required to implement this construct. Because of
this, the following properties have been removed:_ - cloudtrail -
cloudtrailBucket - cloudtrailLoggingBucket

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

=== Amazon S3 Bucket

* Enable EventBridge to send events from the S3 Bucket
* Configure Access logging for S3 Bucket
* Enable server-side encryption for S3 Bucket using AWS managed KMS Key
* Enforce encryption of data in transit
* Turn on the versioning for S3 Bucket
* Don’t allow public access for S3 Bucket
* Retain the S3 Bucket when deleting the CloudFormation stack
* Applies Lifecycle Rule to move noncurrent object versions to Glacier
storage after 90 days

=== AWS S3 Event Notification

* Enable S3 to send events to EventBridge when an object is created.

=== Amazon CloudWatch Events Rule

* Grant least privilege permissions to CloudWatch Events to trigger the
Lambda Function

=== AWS Step Functions

* Enable CloudWatch logging for API Gateway
* Deploy best practices CloudWatch Alarms for the Step Functions
