== Overview

This AWS Solutions Construct implements an Amazon API Gateway REST API
connected to AWS IoT pattern.

This construct creates a scalable HTTPS proxy between API Gateway and
AWS IoT. This comes in handy when wanting to allow legacy devices that
do not support the MQTT or MQTT/Websocket protocol to interact with the
AWS IoT platform.

This implementation enables write-only messages to be published on given
MQTT topics, and also supports shadow updates of HTTPS devices to
allowed things in the device registry. It does not involve Lambda
functions for proxying messages, and instead relies on direct API
Gateway to AWS IoT integration which supports both JSON messages as well
as binary messages.

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition, note that the ATS
endpoint for IoT must be used to avoid SSL certificate issues:

== Pattern Construct Props

[width="100%",cols="<30%,<35%,35%",options="header",]
|===
|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|iotEndpoint |`string` |The AWS IoT endpoint subdomain to integrate the
API Gateway with (e.g a1234567890123-ats). Note that this must point to
the ATS endpoint to avoid SSL certificate trust issues. The endpoint can
be retrieved by running
`aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS`.

|apiGatewayCreateApiKey? |`boolean` |If set to `true`, an API Key is
created and associated to a UsagePlan. User should specify `x-api-key`
header while accessing RestApi. Default value set to `false`

|apiGatewayExecutionRole?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.Role.html[`iam.Role`]
|IAM Role used by the API Gateway to access AWS IoT. If not specified, a
default role is created with wildcard (’++*++’) access to all topics and
things.

|apiGatewayProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.RestApiProps.html[`api.restApiProps`]
|Optional user-provided props to override the default props for the API
Gateway.

|createUsagePlan? |boolean |Whether to create a Usage Plan attached to
the API. Must be true if
apiGatewayProps.defaultMethodOptions.apiKeyRequired is true. @default -
true (to match legacy behavior)

|logGroupProps?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_logs.LogGroupProps.html[`logs.LogGroupProps`]
|User provided props to override the default props for for the
CloudWatchLogs LogGroup.

|*Name* |*Type* |*Description*
|apiGateway
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.RestApi.html[`api.RestApi`]
|Returns an instance of the API Gateway REST API created by the pattern.

|apiGatewayRole
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.Role.html[`iam.Role`]
|Returns an instance of the iam.Role created by the construct for API
Gateway.

|apiGatewayCloudWatchRole?
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.Role.html[`iam.Role`]
|Returns an instance of the iam.Role created by the construct for API
Gateway for CloudWatch access.

|apiGatewayLogGroup
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_logs.LogGroup.html[`logs.LogGroup`]
|Returns an instance of the LogGroup created by the construct for API
Gateway access logging to CloudWatch.
|===

== Default settings

Out of the box implementation of the Construct without any override will
set the following defaults:

==== Amazon API Gateway

* Deploy an edge-optimized API Endpoint
* Creates API Resources with `POST` Method to publish messages to IoT
Topics
* Creates API Resources with `POST` Method to publish messages to
ThingShadow & NamedShadows
* Enable CloudWatch logging for API Gateway
* Configure IAM role for API Gateway with access to all topics and
things
* Set the default authorizationType for all API methods to IAM
* Enable X-Ray Tracing
* Creates a UsagePlan and associates to `prod` stage

Below is a description of the different resources and methods exposed by
the API Gateway after deploying the Construct.

[width="100%",cols="18%,24%,20%,19%,19%",options="header",]
|===
|Method |Resource |Query parameter(s) |Return code(s) |Description
|*POST* |`/message/++<++topics++>++` |*qos* |`200/403/500` |By calling
this endpoint, you need to pass the topics on which you would like to
publish (e.g `/message/device/foo`).

|*POST* |`/shadow/++<++thingName++>++` |*None* |`200/403/500` |This
route allows to update the shadow document of a thing, given its
`thingName` using Unnamed (classic) shadow type. The body shall comply
with the standard shadow structure comprising a `state` node and
associated `desired` and `reported` nodes.

|*POST* |`/shadow/++<++thingName++>++/++<++shadowName++>++` |*None*
|`200/403/500` |This route allows to update the named shadow document of
a thing, given its `thingName` and the `shadowName` using the Named
shadow type. The body shall comply with the standard shadow structure
comprising a `state` node and associated `desired` and `reported` nodes.
